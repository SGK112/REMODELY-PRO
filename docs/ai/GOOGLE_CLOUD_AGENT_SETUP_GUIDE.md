You'll be taken to the agent dashboard where you can:

- Configure voice integration
- Set up webhooks for Twilio integration

## üé§ VOICE INTEGRATION SETUP (After Agent Creation)

### Step 1: Enable Voice Gateway
```javascript
// After agent creation, configure voice
const voiceConfig = {
  telephony: {
    conversationProfile: `projects/YOUR_PROJECT/locations/us-central1/conversationProfiles/YOUR_PROFILE`,
    phoneNumber: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
  },
  audioConfig: {
    synthesizeSpeechConfig: {
      voice: {
        name: 'en-US-Neural2-A', // Much better than Polly
        ssmlGender: 'FEMALE'
      },
      speakingRate: 1.1, // Slightly faster as you requested
      pitch: 2.0 // Higher pitch for younger sound
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Connect to Your Existing System
The agent will integrate with your current:
- Twilio phone system
- Voice webhook handlers
- Customer database (Josh's information)
- Contractor database

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Create the agent** with the settings above
2. **Set up Contractor Recruitment playbook** first (higher ROI)
3. **Test with your phone number** 
4. **Add Homeowner Service playbook**
5. **Integrate with existing webhook system**

## üé§ SPEECH-TO-TEXT CONFIGURATION

### **Recommended Settings:**

#### **Enable Auto Speech Adaptation** ‚úÖ TURN ON
```
‚òëÔ∏è Enable auto speech adaptation
Use agent information (e.g. intents, entities) to automatically improve speech recognition quality.
```
**Why:** This helps the agent better understand contractor terminology like "countertops," "backsplash," "kitchen renovation," etc.

#### **Advanced Speech Settings** ‚úÖ TURN ON  
```
‚òëÔ∏è Enable advanced speech settings
Configure agent-level advanced settings for speech features.
```
**Benefits:**
- Better recognition of construction industry terms
- Improved handling of proper names (contractor names, cities)
- Enhanced recognition of budget numbers and project timelines

#### **DTMF Settings** ‚ùå LEAVE OFF (For Now)
```
‚òê Enable DTMF
Allow Conversational Agents to process incoming audio as DTMF events.
```
**Why Skip:** DTMF is for phone keypad inputs. Your conversations are voice-only, so this isn't needed initially.

## üìû CALL COMPANION RECOMMENDATIONS

### **What is Call Companion?**
Call Companion provides real-time assistance during calls, helping agents with:
- Suggested responses during objections

#### **Key Features to Configure:**
1. **Real-time Suggestions:** Provides response options during difficult moments
