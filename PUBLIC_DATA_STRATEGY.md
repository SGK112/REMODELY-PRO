# Public Data Scraping Strategy for Remodely.AI

## üéØ **Revised Strategy: Public & Government Sources**

You're absolutely right about the vendor accounts! Let's focus on **publicly available information** that's completely legal and appropriate to scrape.

## üèõÔ∏è **Government License Databases**

### **State Contractor License Registries**
These are **public records** designed for consumer protection:

**Arizona ROC (Registrar of Contractors)**
- URL: `https://roc.az.gov/license-lookup`
- Data: Licensed contractors, specialties, license status, contact info
- **100% legal** - public consumer protection database

**California CSLB (Contractors State License Board)**
- URL: `https://www.cslb.ca.gov/OnlineServices/CheckLicenseII/CheckLicense.aspx`
- Data: Licensed contractors, classifications, bond status

**Texas TREC (Texas Real Estate Commission)**
- URL: `https://www.trec.texas.gov/license-holder-search`
- Data: Licensed inspectors and contractors

**Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation**
- URL: `https://www.myfloridalicense.com/LicenseDetail.asp`
- Data: Professional licenses including contractors

### **Why Government Sources are Perfect:**
- ‚úÖ **Public records** - designed for consumer access
- ‚úÖ **High quality data** - verified license information
- ‚úÖ **Legal to scrape** - public information by law
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive** - covers all licensed contractors in the state
- ‚úÖ **Regularly updated** - maintained by government agencies

## üè¢ **Public Business Directories**

### **Better Business Bureau (BBB)**
- URL: `https://www.bbb.org/search`
- Data: Accredited businesses with ratings, contact info, complaints
- **Legitimate** - BBB makes business info public for consumer protection

### **Yellow Pages**
- URL: `https://www.yellowpages.com`
- Data: Business listings, phone numbers, addresses, categories
- **Public directory** - designed for consumers to find businesses

### **Google Business Listings**
- URL: Google Local Search results
- Data: Business names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, reviews
- **Public information** - businesses choose to list publicly

### **Industry Association Member Directories**

**National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA)**
- URL: `https://nkba.org/find-a-professional`
- Data: Certified professionals, specialties, locations
- **Public member directory**

**Marble Institute of America**
- URL: `https://marble-institute.com/find-a-professional`
- Data: Stone industry professionals, certifications

**Natural Stone Institute**
- URL: `https://naturalstoneinstitute.org/members`
- Data: Industry members, specialties, locations

## üîç **Search-Based Discovery**

### **Google Search Strategies**
Instead of scraping private platforms, use Google to find:
- `"countertop contractors" + city + state`
- `"granite installation" + location`
- `"kitchen remodeling" + area`
- `site:bbb.org countertop contractors`
- `site:yellowpages.com granite contractors`

### **Bing and Alternative Search Engines**
- Often return different results than Google
- May find contractors missed by Google search
- Can target local business directories

## üìä **Data Quality & Sources Ranking**

### **Tier 1: Government Sources** (Highest Quality)
1. **Arizona ROC Database** - Licensed contractors with verified info
