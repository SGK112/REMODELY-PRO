## üìä Current System Status

### **Database Population**
```
Total ROC Contractors: 1,000
Top License Classes:
  - C-35 (Lathing & Plastering): 31
  - C-46 (Tile/Stone): 29
  - A (General Engineering): 28
  - C-5 (Roofing): 28
  - Plus 41 other license types

Top Cities:
  - Oro Valley: 40 contractors
  - Show Low: 38 contractors
  - Marana: 38 contractors
  - Plus 30 other Arizona cities
```

### **Available Commands**
```bash
# Sample Data Management
npm run roc:seed      # Generate 1000 sample contractors
npm run roc:stats     # Show contractor statistics
npm run roc:clear     # Clear all ROC contractors

# CSV Processing (when you have actual CSV)
npm run roc:convert input.csv jsonl     # Convert to JSON Lines
npm run roc:convert input.csv sqlite    # Convert to SQLite
npm run roc:convert input.csv regions   # Split by regions
npm run roc:convert input.csv all       # Run all conversions

# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma database browser
```

## üöÄ Next Steps for Your CSV File

### **Option 1: Clean & Convert CSV**
When you get a clean CSV file:
```bash
# Convert to optimized format
npm run roc:convert your-file.csv all

# This creates:
# - data/roc-contractors.jsonl (fastest processing)
# - data/roc-contractors.db (SQLite with indexes)
# - data/regions/ (split by geographic areas)
# - data/prisma-seed.js (ready-to-run seed file)
```

### **Option 2: Direct Import**
For immediate results with your current CSV:
1. Clean the CSV (remove problematic characters, fix encoding)
2. Use the converter with smaller batches
3. Import in chunks to avoid memory issues

### **Option 3: Manual Processing**
1. Extract key fields: License Number, Business Name, Address, License Class
2. Use Excel/Numbers to clean and validate data
3. Export as clean CSV for processing
