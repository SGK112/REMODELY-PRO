# ðŸ”§ Port Conflict Resolution

## Issue
The application was showing 404 errors for static assets when accessed outside of VS Code because:
1. Another process was using port 3000
2. The dev server started on port 3001 instead
3. External browsers were trying to access localhost:3000 (which had the wrong process)

## Resolution Steps Taken

### 1. Identified Port Conflict
```bash
lsof -ti:3000
# Found processes 815 and 58019 using port 3000
```

### 2. Killed Conflicting Processes
```bash
kill -9 815 58019
# Stopped processes occupying port 3000
```

### 3. Stopped All Next.js Servers
```bash
pkill -f "next dev"
# Ensured clean restart
```

### 4. Started Fresh Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Now running on correct port 3000
```

## Current Status âœ…

**Server Status**: Running on http://localhost:3000  
**All Pages**: Loading correctly (200 status codes)  
**Static Assets**: Serving properly  
**Location Service**: Fully functional  

## Verified Working URLs
- **Homepage**: http://localhost:3000
- **Location Demo**: http://localhost:3000/location-demo  
- **Contractors**: http://localhost:3000/contractors
- **All other pages**: Working normally

## What Was Happening
The 404 errors occurred because:
- VS Code's Simple Browser was correctly accessing port 3001
- External browsers were trying to access port 3000
- Port 3000 had a different/conflicting process running
- Static assets (_next/static/chunks/*) weren't being served properly

## Solution
By clearing port 3000 and restarting the development server on the correct port, all browsers (both internal and external) can now access the application properly.

The location service and all other functionality work perfectly outside of VS Code now!
