# User-Controlled Image and Profile Management System

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive profile management system that gives contractors and customers full control over their images and content. This system replaces static Unsplash images with user-uploaded content and provides complete profile management capabilities.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔧 Image Upload System
- **Professional Image Service**: `lib/cloudinary.ts` with ImageUploadService class
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary integration with optimization and transformations
- **Local Fallback**: File system storage in `/public/uploads/` with profile/portfolio folders
- **File Validation**: 5MB size limit, JPEG/PNG/WebP support only
- **Authentication**: User ownership verification and rate limiting (10 uploads per 15 minutes)

### 👷 Contractor Profile Management
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Updated contractor dashboard with "Manage Profile" link
- **Profile Page**: `/dashboard/contractor/manage` with complete image and content control
- **Profile Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop profile image upload with real-time preview
- **Portfolio Management**: Multiple portfolio image uploads with thumbnail gallery
- **Business Details**: Edit business name, description, contact info, specialties
- **Database Integration**: Proper JSON handling for specialties and portfolio images

### 👤 Customer Profile Management  
- **Customer Dashboard**: Updated customer dashboard with "Manage Profile" link
- **Profile Page**: `/dashboard/customer/manage` with personal information control
- **Profile Image Upload**: Personal profile image management
- **Personal Details**: Edit name, phone, address, and contact information
- **Profile Completeness**: Visual progress indicator for profile completion

### 🔌 API Infrastructure
- **Upload API**: `/api/upload` handles profile and portfolio image uploads
- **Contractor API**: `/api/contractor/profile` for contractor profile CRUD operations
- **Customer API**: `/api/customer/profile` for customer profile CRUD operations
- **Authentication**: NextAuth integration with session management
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiting for upload protection

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Contractors:
1. Navigate to **Contractor Dashboard** → **Manage Profile**
2. Upload profile image by clicking camera icon
3. Add portfolio images with **Add Image** button
4. Edit business details in-place with **Edit Profile** button
5. Images are automatically optimized and stored
6. Portfolio images populate throughout site search functions

### For Customers:
1. Navigate to **Customer Dashboard** → **Manage Profile** 
2. Upload personal profile image
3. Update personal information and contact details
4. Profile completeness indicator shows progress
5. Images display in customer interactions and reviews

### Technical Flow:
1. **Image Upload**: Files validated → uploaded to Cloudinary/local storage → database updated
2. **Profile Updates**: Form data → API validation → database update → real-time UI refresh
3. **Search Integration**: Uploaded images automatically appear in contractor search results
4. **Authentication**: Every action verified against user session and ownership

## 🔒 Security Features

## 🎉 Result
Contractors and customers now have complete control over their images and profile content, creating a more personalized and professional experience. The system automatically populates user-uploaded content throughout the site's search functions, replacing generic stock images with authentic, relevant visuals that better represent each user's unique offerings and personality.

This implementation fulfills the user's requirement: *"We need the contractors to have control over their images, they should be able to upload images and content into their profile which populates through out the site search functions. This way they are in control of their image and content."*
