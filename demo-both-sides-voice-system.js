      Hi, this is Sarah from REMODELY AI. I hope I'm catching you at a good time.
      
      <break time="0.5s"/>
      
      We're a renovation marketplace that connects qualified homeowners with vetted contractors like yourself. 
      
      I'm calling because we have several homeowners in the Phoenix area specifically looking for kitchen renovation work, and your business came up as a perfect fit.
      
      <break time="0.5s"/>
      
      Are you currently taking on new kitchen projects, or is your schedule pretty full right now?

      No problem at all. Let me tell you quickly what makes our platform different.
      
      <break time="0.5s"/>
      
      We pre-qualify every homeowner for budget, timeline, and project readiness before they ever contact you. 
      
      Our contractors report a 75% close rate on our leads versus the 20% industry average.
      
      <break time="0.5s"/>
      
      Plus, there are no upfront costs - we only charge a small percentage when you successfully complete a project.
      
      <break time="1s"/>
      
      Can I get you set up with a contractor profile today? It takes about 5 minutes and you can start receiving qualified leads this week.
