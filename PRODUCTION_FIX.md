## URGENT: Fix Sharp and Image Issues

Your production site is experiencing image optimization errors. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Install Sharp (Image Optimization)

**Option A: Deploy with Sharp in package.json**
The `sharp` package has been added to your package.json. Your next deployment will automatically install it.

**Option B: Manual Installation (if you have terminal access to production)**
```bash
npm install sharp@^0.33.0
```

### 2. Database Migration (Super Admin Features)

Run these commands to enable your admin system:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Create Super Admin Account

After deployment, visit: `https://remodely-ai-com.onrender.com/api/admin/setup`

Send POST request with:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Admin Name",
  "email": "your-admin@email.com",
  "password": "secure-admin-password"
}
```

### 4. Access Admin Dashboard

Once super admin is created: `https://remodely-ai-com.onrender.com/dashboard/admin`

### 5. Fix Broken Images (Optional)

If you have terminal access, run this command to fix all broken Unsplash URLs:
```bash
find . -name "*.tsx" -type f -exec sed -i 's/1556909195-4e5d4d6e4f6f/1556909114-f6e7ad7d3136/g' {} \;
```
