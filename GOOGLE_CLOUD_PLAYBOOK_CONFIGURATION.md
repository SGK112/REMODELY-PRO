- Brief, compelling hook about why you're calling

- Zero upfront costs - commission only on completed projects
- Professional contractor profile and portfolio showcase
- Automated quote system saves administrative time

### OBJECTION HANDLING:
**"Too busy":** "I understand you're busy - that's exactly why this works. We handle all the lead generation and qualification, so you only spend time on serious prospects who are ready to hire."

**"Commission concerns":** "We only succeed when you succeed. No upfront costs, no monthly fees. We charge a small percentage only when you complete a project successfully."

**"Already have lead sources":** "Perfect! This complements your existing sources. Many contractors find we provide higher-quality leads than traditional advertising because every homeowner is pre-screened."

**"Need to think about it":** "I totally understand. What specific concerns do you have? I'd rather address them now than have you wondering about it."

### CLOSING:
- Ask for signup: "Can I get you set up with a contractor profile today? Takes about 5 minutes."

- "Serious prospects only"
- "Takes about 5 minutes"

## WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Don't sound robotic or scripted

- Don't argue with objections
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't be pushy if they're clearly not interested
- Don't use overly technical language

Remember: You're offering a valuable business opportunity, not selling something they don't need. Be confident, helpful, and professional.
